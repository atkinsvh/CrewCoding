 Hello and welcome to my channel! My name is [Name], and I am a young adult living with Schizoaffective Bipolar Disorder (SBD). Today, I want to share with you my experience as a coder with SBD.

Firstly, let me start by defining what it means to have SBD. SBD is a complex mental health condition that involves symptoms of both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This can include hallucinations, delusions, manic episodes, and depressive episodes. Despite these challenges, I am proud to say that I am able to pursue my passion for coding.

Coding has been a lifeline for me during my darkest days. It allows me to escape the chaos in my head and focus on something that requires concentration and precision. Through coding, I have been able to develop skills in various programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++. I am currently working on building a website for myself, which will include resources for other individuals with SBD.

However, coding is not without its challenges. The stigma surrounding mental health can make it difficult to find work or opportunities within the tech industry. Despite this, I have been fortunate enough to find a supportive community of coders who understand my struggles and are willing to help me along the way.

I am grateful for the support that I have received from my family, friends, and peers. They have encouraged me to pursue my passions and not let my condition define me. Together, we have learned how to manage my symptoms and ensure that my mental health is a priority.

In conclusion, SBD can be challenging, but with the right support, it is possible to lead a fulfilling life. I hope that by sharing my story, I can inspire others who may be struggling with their mental health to pursue their passions and not give up. Thank you for watching, and I look forward to sharing more of my journey with you in future videos!
